user_validator_prompt = '''Your task is to simulate a user with no knowledge of SQL or database management systems, who needs specific information from an EHR database and relies on the DB agent for help.

Instruction: {instruction}

Rules:
- The current time is 2100-12-31 23:59:00.
- Start with a short, broad question that reflects the overall goals from the instruction.
- Use your own words to describe your goals for the DB agent.
- Do not reveal all your goals at once. Instead, share them gradually, one or two sentences at a time.
- Speak casually and directly, without functionally unnecessary phrases (like "please" or "thank you") that make the tone sound like an AI assistant.
- Do not generate SQL, code snippets, empty messages, or AI-assistant-like outputs. Stay in the role of a user, not a DB agent.
- If the DB agent requests specific tables or column names, instruct it to locate them independently (unless the instruction says otherwise).
- If the DB agent requests writing or reviewing SQL queries, or summarizing the overall goal, instruct it to complete the task independently.
- If the DB agent gives an intermediate answer, don't complete it yourself. Instead, instruct it to finalize it (e.g., performing calculations like time differences or rephrasing answers).
- If the DB agent's answer seems satisfactory (even though you do not know whether it is correct or whether the requested data actually exists), ask the DB agent to double check that their final answer covers all goals raised. If not, request any missing parts.
- If the DB agent's answer covers all goals raised, generate only "###END###" to end the conversation. Do not add it after every reply. Use it only once in the final message.
- Do not deviate from what is specified in the instruction, such as failing to mention the top N ranked tied results to retrieve, requesting medication order records or prescription records instead of administered records, requesting 6 months of data instead of 180 days, asking follow-up questions when they are not specified in the instruction, or revealing disallowed information before the DB agent mentions it.

Conversation:
{conversation}

Gold SQL:
{gold_sql}

Types of common user errors:
- The user gives away their goals all at once in the same turn.
- The user acts like a DB agent or AI assistant instead of the user (e.g., writing, reviewing, or executing SQL queries, calling external APIs, or responding to the DB agent in a machine assistant way).
- The user asks for information that is slightly different from what is specified in the instruction (e.g., requesting medication order records or prescription records instead of administered records, or requesting 6 months of data instead of 180 days).
- The user confirms values that differ from those in the gold SQL, unless specified otherwise in the instruction (e.g., requesting data for just "diabetes" when the gold SQL uses LIKE "%diabetes%").
- The user mentions information beyond the instruction, including related or unrelated details not specified (e.g., asking follow-up questions not in the instruction).
- The user does not provide all the detailed conditions specified in the instruction before ending the conversation. These conditions may include, for example, retrieving all tied ranked results, specifying the top "N" results to retrieve, handling duplicate patient records, or indicating keywords to include or exclude when searching for data. However, if the DB agent retrieves no relevant data, these conditions are not required.
- The user does not provide all the detailed conditions specified in the predicates of the gold SQL, either explicitly or implicitly, before ending the conversation.
- The user does not double-check with the DB agent to see if the agent's final answer satisfies all the information the user provided before ending the conversation.
- The user violates any other rules specified in the rules or the user instruction.

You must respond in JSON format with the following fields:
- explanation: Provide a clear and concise explanation of why you made the decision.
- broken_rule: If a user error is found, provide the exact rule or instruction that the user violated. If no error is found, provide an empty string.
- evidence: If a user error is found, provide the exact user response that caused the error. If no error is found, provide an empty string.
- result: Answer "user_error" if a user error is found. Answer "no_error" if no user error is found.'''


agent_validator_prompt = '''Below are the general rules for the DB agent:
- The DB agent must assume the user has no knowledge of SQL, databases, or stored values, and cannot execute queries.
- The DB agent must interact with the user only in natural language and must not show raw SQL queries.
- The DB agent must not modify the database schema or contents. The following commands are forbidden: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, DROP, ALTER.
- The DB agent must always explain answers in natural language, including the reasoning or conditions used to arrive at those answers. If SQL references are necessary, the DB agent must explain them in terms understandable to someone with no SQL knowledge.
- The DB agent must clearly explain when a question cannot be answered (e.g., due to limitations of SQL or empty results) and ask the user to rephrase or modify the request.
- The DB agent must generate a non-empty response. It must include either a message or a tool call.
